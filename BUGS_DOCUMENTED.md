## Bug #1: Edit Card State Persistence Across Navigation

### Bug Details
- **ID:** BUG-001
- **Title:** Edit Card state persists after navigation away
- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** State Management / Navigation
- **Date Reported:** 2025-07-01
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Description
When users navigate through the application in a specific sequence, the Edit Card UI state incorrectly persists, causing the Add Card screen to display Edit Card interface elements.

### Technical Root Cause
The form state management in the `useFormStore` was not properly resetting the `isEditing` flag and related state when navigating away from Edit Card mode. The state persisted across navigation events.

### User Impact
- **Frequency:** High (occurs with common navigation patterns)
- **User Experience:** Confusing interface state
- **Data Integrity:** Low risk (cosmetic issue)
- **Accessibility:** Interface labels become misleading

### Reproduction Steps
```
1. Navigate to Add Card page (/add)
2. Navigate to Home page (/)
3. Click "Edit" on any existing card (/edit/:id)
4. Navigate back to Home page (/)
5. Navigate to Add Card page (/add)

Expected: Clean "Add New Card" interface
Actual: "Edit Card" interface with stale data
```

### Technical Details
**Affected Files:**
- `src/screens/AddCard.tsx` (lines 45-60)
- `src/store/formStore.ts` (state management)

**State Variables Affected:**
- `isEditing: boolean`
- `editingCardId: string | undefined`
- `cardLoaded: boolean`

### Fix Implementation
1. **Enhanced navigation handlers** - Added proper state cleanup in navigation buttons
2. **Improved effect logic** - Better handling of edit vs add mode transitions
3. **State isolation** - Cleaner separation between add and edit modes

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: No cleanup on navigation
const handleNavigateHome = () => navigate('/');

// After: Proper state management
const handleNavigateHome = useCallback(() => {
  if (isEditing) {
    setEditing(false);
    setCardLoaded(false);
  }
  navigate('/');
}, [isEditing, setEditing, setCardLoaded, navigate]);
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Navigation flow testing
- ✅ State persistence verification
- ✅ UI element validation
- ✅ Multiple navigation cycles

## Bug #2: Edit Card Form Fields Not Populated

### Bug Details
- **ID:** BUG-002
- **Title:** Edit Card fields show placeholders instead of data
- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Data Population / State Management
- **Date Reported:** 2025-07-01
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Description
When navigating to Edit Card mode through specific navigation paths, the Vietnamese and Example fields display placeholder text instead of being populated with the actual card data.

### Technical Root Cause
Overly aggressive form reset logic was clearing form data before the Edit Card component could properly populate it with existing card data. Race condition between state reset and data population.

### User Impact
- **Frequency:** Medium (specific navigation patterns)
- **User Experience:** Data appears lost
- **Data Integrity:** High risk (potential data loss if user saves)
- **Workflow Disruption:** Users cannot edit existing cards effectively

### Reproduction Steps
```
1. Navigate to Add Card page (/add)
2. Navigate to Home page (/)
3. Click "Edit" on any card with data (/edit/:id)

Expected: Form fields populated with existing card data
Actual: Vietnamese and Example fields show placeholder text
```

### Technical Details
**Affected Files:**
- `src/screens/AddCard.tsx` (lines 46-60, effect hooks)
- `src/store/formStore.ts` (population methods)

**Functions Affected:**
- `populateFromCard(card)`
- `resetForm()`
- Navigation effect hooks

### Fix Implementation
1. **Removed aggressive cleanup** - Eliminated premature form reset in navigation
2. **Improved effect ordering** - Better sequencing of data population
3. **Conditional reset logic** - Only reset when transitioning from edit to add mode

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Aggressive reset causing data loss
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (isEditing) {
      resetForm(); // Too early!
    }
  };
}, [isEditing, resetForm]);

// After: Targeted reset logic
useEffect(() => {
  if (id) {
    // Load edit data
    const card = cards.find((c) => c.id === id);
    if (card) {
      populateFromCard(card);
      setEditing(true, id);
    }
  } else {
    // Only reset if transitioning from edit mode
    if (isEditing) {
      resetForm();
    }
  }
  setCardLoaded(true);
}, [id, cards, populateFromCard, setEditing, setCardLoaded, isEditing, resetForm]);
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Data population verification
- ✅ Field-by-field validation
- ✅ Multiple navigation path testing
- ✅ Race condition prevention

## Testing Strategy & Implementation

### Testing Framework
- **Primary:** Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Approach:** Integration testing focused on user workflows
- **Coverage:** Navigation flows, state management, data integrity

### Test Categories

#### 1. Navigation Flow Tests
Tests covering various user navigation patterns to ensure state consistency.

#### 2. State Management Tests
Verification that application state remains consistent across all user interactions.

#### 3. Data Integrity Tests
Ensuring user data is preserved and correctly displayed during edit operations.

#### 4. Edge Case Tests
Testing unusual but possible user interaction patterns.

### Test Files Structure

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Automated Testing
- **Integration tests** covering all critical navigation flows
- **State management tests** ensuring proper cleanup
- **Data population tests** verifying form field behavior

### 2. Development Guidelines
- **State cleanup rules** - Clear guidelines for when/how to reset state
- **Navigation patterns** - Standardized navigation handling
- **Testing requirements** - Mandatory test coverage for new features

### 3. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] State management cleanup on navigation
- [ ] Form data population in edit mode
- [ ] Effect hook dependency arrays
- [ ] Race condition considerations

### 4. Monitoring & Detection
- **Test coverage reports** ensuring critical paths are tested
- **State management linting** rules to catch potential issues
- **Integration test automation** in CI/CD pipeline

---

## Future Considerations

### Technical Debt
1. **State management consolidation** - Consider centralizing form state logic
2. **Navigation abstraction** - Create reusable navigation patterns
3. **Effect cleanup patterns** - Standardize cleanup logic across components

### Enhancement Opportunities
1. **State debugging tools** - Add development-time state inspection
2. **Navigation guards** - Prevent navigation with unsaved changes
3. **Form validation** - Add comprehensive form validation

## Test Execution Instructions

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test
